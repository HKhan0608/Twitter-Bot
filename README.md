Team Member 1 (**Haseeb Khan**)  Team Member 2 (**Siraj Munir**)

## Overview
We want to build a twitter bot that helps in promoting and increasing social media campaigns or make it trend in real time in an automated and efficient manner. 

## Background
As we already know Twitter is one of the most used social media platforms, so considering that we opted to take this platform and play with it. 
This project will help small businesses and startups to kickstart their business in the market. They could use help in marketing, brand promotions, and promoting their new products to the consumers.

## Implementation Strategy
We will be using the twitter API to gain access to twitter and its functionalities. Furthermore, we will be using the tweepy classes namely,
1.	Authhandler:	for authentication of the requests required by the twitter API.
2.	API Class: to call the twitter API methods (e.g., method for tweets, method for followers, method for likes, method for searches).
3.	Models: classes that contain the data/results from the tweepy methods. 

Furthermore, we will be using the **tweepy** library/package for accessing the **twitter API** with python and doing most of our project using this package's methods and classes.

## Tasks
In this project we will be performing the following tasks,
1.	Automatically follow the users in the followers list. (Condition: having 100 followers)
2.	Certain followersâ€™ tweet will be retweeted/liked.
3.	Will reply with a generated message to certain keywords. (e.g., price/help/support)
4.	Will send direct messages to the followers regarding product promotion, offers etc. (limit: 1000/day)
